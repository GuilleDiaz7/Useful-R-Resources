# A bunch of resources related to text data
First of all, the [book](https://www.tidytextmining.com/) by Julia Silge and David Robinson is a terrific introduction (much more of it) to text mining. 

## Packages
1. The package [geniusr](https://github.com/ewenme/geniusr) is fantastic to download music data (albums, songs, lyrics) and analyse data from your favorite artists.

## Project examples
1. A nice [example](https://github.com/aaumaitre/taylor_swift) to working with lyrics data from a Taylor Swift fan.
2. A fantastic [blog](https://www.jorgelopezperez.com/posts/analisis-de-texto-con-r-jugando-un-poco-con-tidytext/) using Twitter data on his favorite football team.
